\prob{2.24 a}  Consider a choice of four unique objects and specify a specific, arbitrarily picked object to be "special".  We can model this situation using two random variables $X$ and $Y$.  We define $X$ to be the random variable describing whether the "special" object was picked with $X = 0$ if the "special" object was picked and $X = 1$ otherwise.  The entropy of this random variable, $H \left( X \right)$, is the entropy we seek to find, namely $H \left( 1 / 4 \right)$.  Continuing, we define $Y$ to be the random variable describing which of the three "non-special" items was picked with $Y = 0$ if the first "non-special" object was picked, $Y = 1$ for the second being picked, $Y = 2$ if the third object was picked, and $Y = 3$ is the fourth object was picked.  The joint probability distribution for these two random variables is given as
