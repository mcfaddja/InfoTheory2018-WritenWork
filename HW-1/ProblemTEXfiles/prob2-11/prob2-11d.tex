\prob{2.11 d}  Again, from the expression in \ref{c2p11eq1}, it is clear that $\rho = 1$ only if $\Hent{X_2 \mid X_1} = 0$.  For this to be the case, $X_2$ \emph{\textbf{must}} be a function of $X_1$.  Additionally, that function must be \textbf{one-to-one}, since the relation in \ref{c2p10eq2} implies symmetry which means that $X_1$ can also be represented as a function of $X_2$.
