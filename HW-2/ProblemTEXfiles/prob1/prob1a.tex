\prob{1 a}  An Error-Correcting Code is a code which generates redundant information, based on the original message to be sent.  This redundant information is then added to the original message, resulting in an "augmented message" which is then sent to the receiver down some channel.  The redundant information in the quote “augmented matrix” allows the receiver to determine if errors have been made during transmission, so long at the number of errors that occur is not greater than the number of errors the code can detect.  Furthermore, the redundant information in the quote “augmented matrix” also allows the receiver to recover the original message so long as the number of errors in the received “augmented message” does not exceed the number of errors the code can correct.
